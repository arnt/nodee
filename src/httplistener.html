<h1 class="classh">Class HttpListener.</h1>
<p class="text">The HttpListener class listens for connections from clients on a single socket, and when one arrives, it creates a suitable <a href="httpserver.html">HttpServer</a> in a thread of its own.
<p class="text">HttpListener has one particular weakness: Since it listens on one socket, if nodee is run in a mixed ipv4/6 environment, nodee has to create two HttpListener objects. Creating two may however fail, leaving nodee with the unenviable task of finding out whether the failure is innocent or serious. I didn't like putting ::exit() calls in HttpListener, so I put all that logic in main. 
<h2 class="functionh"><a name="HttpListener"></a>HttpListener::HttpListener( HttpListener::Family family, int port, <span class=nobr><a href="init.html">Init</a> &amp; i )</span></h2>
<p class="text">Constructs an HTTP listener for <i>port</i> using <i>family</i> (V4 or V6), creating HttpServers connected to <i>i</i> when clients connect. 
<h2 class="functionh"><a name="operator()"></a>void HttpListener::operator()()</h2>
<p class="text">boost::thread wants to call <a href="httplistener.html#start">start()</a> by this name, so here's a wrapper around <a href="httplistener.html#start">start()</a>. 
<h2 class="functionh"><a name="start"></a>void HttpListener::start()</h2>
<p class="text">Called to start the thread. Does all that the listener needs, which doesn't involve very many lines of code.
<p class="text">Never exits, which seems like a modest problem. I don't see any reason why the
<p class="text">
<h2 class="functionh"><a name="valid"></a>bool HttpListener::valid() const</h2>
<p class="text">Returns true if the listener actually is listening to something, and false if some problem prevents it from achieving anything.
