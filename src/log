<h1 class="classh">Class Log.</h1>
<p class="text">Log is Nodee's logging helper; a set of ostreams to be used for logging.
<p class="text">One can write to the debug logger merely by using the ostream debug. At the moment that's cerr, but it can be something else.
<p class="text">An implementation note: By playing around with two ostream classes, it's possible to gather the output from composite operations such as debug &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; b and send them to the log server as one string. Slightly tricky, but doable, so I think this design is right. 
<h2 class="functionh"><a name="setupStderr"></a>static void Log::setupStderr()</h2>
<p class="text">This static function initialises the log system to write everything to stderr.
